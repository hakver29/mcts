        Selection: start from root R and select successive child nodes until a leaf node L is reached. The root is the current game state and a leaf is any node from which no simulation (playout) has yet been initiated. The section below says more about a way of biasing choice of child nodes that lets the game tree expand towards the most promising moves, which is the essence of Monte Carlo tree search.
        
        Expansion: unless L ends the game decisively (e.g. win/loss/draw) for either player, create one (or more) child nodes and choose node C from one of them. Child nodes are any valid moves from the game position defined by L.
        
        Simulation: complete one random playout from node C. This step is sometimes also called playout or rollout. A playout may be as simple as choosing uniform random moves until the game is decided (for example in chess, the game is won, lost, or drawn).
        
        Backpropagation: use the result of the playout to update information in the nodes on the path from C to R.

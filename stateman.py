"""
1. Tree Search - Traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node by using the tree policy.
2. Node Expansion - Generating some or all child states of a parent state, and then connecting the tree
node housing the parent state (a.k.a. parent node) to the nodes housing the child states (a.k.a. child
nodes).
3. Leaf Evaluation - Estimating the value of a leaf node in the tree by doing a rollout simulation using
the default policy from the leaf nodeâ€™s state to a final state.
4. Backpropagation - Passing the evaluation of a final state back up the tree, updating relevant data (see
course lecture notes) at all nodes and edges on the path from the final state to the tree root.
